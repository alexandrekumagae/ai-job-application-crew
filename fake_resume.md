## Work History

### Twygo: Software Architect — 2024 - Present
After three months at Twygo, I took on the challenge of working as a Software Architect, actively participating in the creation and optimization of application components. My responsibilities include implementing solutions focused on scalability, security, and efficiency, using technologies such as Ruby on Rails, React, TypeScript, AWS, Docker, MySQL, Kubernetes, Jenkins, AirBrake, Grafana, and NewRelic. I work in collaboration with development teams to ensure that architectures meet business needs and enable sustainable and efficient system growth.
Recently, I took on the leadership of Generative Artificial Intelligence initiatives at Twygo, working directly on implementing practical and integrated solutions to our product, with a focus on adding value to users and company processes.

At Twygo, I was part of the squad responsible for innovation projects, where I had the opportunity to implement new features on the platform, enhancing our users' experience. I worked with technologies such as Ruby on Rails, React, TypeScript, among others, to develop efficient and scalable solutions.

### Move Marketing Digital: Front-end Developer | Partner (remote) — 2016 - 2024
At Move Digital, I migrated to the Front-end area and also learned a lot about User Experience (UX) in projects for clients such as Cristo Redentor Sanctuary, Floratil, and A.C.Camargo, improving interfaces to better meet user expectations. I worked primarily in Front-end with technologies such as React, Next.js, Vue.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, and WordPress, but when necessary, I also worked in Back-end, using technologies such as Node.js, PHP, MySQL, as well as infrastructure in Linux, Linode, Digital Ocean, and GCP. This experience transformed me into a versatile Web Developer capable of aligning user needs with business objectives, actively contributing to discussions with stakeholders and providing support to clients.
In January 2020, I became a partner at Move Digital, a milestone that recognized my dedication and contributions, allowing me to influence administrative and strategic decisions, as well as guide our development team, cultivating technique and collaboration. The following year, I led the development of MoveMenu, a SaaS project that diversified our services, aligning project needs with team capabilities and keeping business objectives in focus.
Starting in August 2022, I also took on project management, improving interaction with stakeholders and unifying teams under cohesive leadership. This trajectory demonstrates my growth, adaptability, and commitment to the company's continued success.

### D4w Comunicacao (remote) — 2014 - 2016
- Promoted to Back-end Developer, I expanded my functions to train new team members and participate in technical decisions, promoting an environment of collaboration and learning. I initiated the adoption of emerging technologies, such as PhoneGap development for hybrid applications, diversifying the company's services and generating new market opportunities, contributing significantly to organizational and team growth.
